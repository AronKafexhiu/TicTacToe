#Tic Tac Toe
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game written in Java using the help of the GUI elements of the Swing Library. It's a local multiplayer game. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. You can choose where you want to play just by clicking on that spot. If a round ends you can play more if you want to or just stop there. If you do choose to play more the program will remember the scores until you stop.
