# Tic Tac Toe
This is a simple [*Tic Tac Toe*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game written in Java using the help of the GUI elements of the [Swing Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)). It's a local multiplayer game. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. You can choose where you want to play just by clicking on that spot. If a round ends you can play more if you want to or just stop there. If you do choose to play more the program will remember the scores until you stop.
